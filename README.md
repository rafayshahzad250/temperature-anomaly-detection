# Temperature Anomaly Detection 

This repository is a project for detecting anomalies in temperature sensor data using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## What’s inside
- **notebooks/**: interactive notebooks to explore data, build baselines, and train models
- **src/**: helper utilities for data simulation and feature engineering (lightweight; notebooks-first)
- **data/**: local data folders (git-ignored)
- **models/**: place to save trained models (git-ignored)
- **reports/**: figures and artifacts generated by notebooks
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml**: linters/formatters for cleanliness
- **requirements.txt** and **environment.yml**: install dependencies via pip or conda

## Quickstart

### Option A — venv + pip (simple)
```bash
# from repo root
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# launch jupyter lab
jupyter lab
```

### Option B — conda (alternative)
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate temp-anomaly
jupyter lab
```

Then open `notebooks/01_synthetic_data_and_baselines.ipynb` and run the cells top-to-bottom.

## Project Flow (suggested)
1. **Explore data** (synthetic first), visualize rolling mean/std, z-score detector.
2. **Isolation Forest** baseline on windowed features.
3. (Optional) **Autoencoder** for sequence reconstruction.
4. Evaluate precision/recall on labeled anomalies; tune thresholds.
5. Package a simple “monitor” function to score new readings in real time.

## Notes
- The repo is **not** tied to cloud; everything runs locally.
- `data/` and `models/` are ignored by git to avoid large artifacts.
- If you later want streaming, we’ll add a small loop + buffer to score incoming points.
